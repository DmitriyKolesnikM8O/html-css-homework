        And another quick
        knock out for Mason Dixon,
        although de facto, the fans let
        him know how they feel about it.
        Hide the women and
        children, this could get ugly.
        This crowd does
        nothing to hide its anger,
        over this latest debacle.
        Fans are mad as hell, they
        don't want to take it anymore.
        They seem to be blaming
        Dixon, a good fighter,
        for decline of not only the
        heavy-weight division guys,
        but of the entire sport.
        They're actually pelting the undefeated
        heavy-weight champion
        of the world with ice!
        Maybe this angry visceral reaction
        will pressure Dixon to fight someone
        who could fight back for a change.
        If there's somebody out there.
        World of the boxing is hoping for a
        warrior who threw us with his passion.

        Time goes by too fast.
        Yeah, not fast enough.
        Your kid should've been there.
        Nah, it's alright, Paulie.
        No, it ain't alright!
        Oh you know, the kid gets
        a little busy sometimes.
        He don't get that busy.
        Well, let's not talk
        about it here, okay?
        You're coming tonight, right?
        I'm working!
        I took the tour the last three years!
        I know, but it's the anniversary.
        Fine, you got my word.
        I appreciate it, thank you.
        I owe you, Paulie.
        Yo, Robert. What's going on?
        Where have you been? You're late!
        No, I don't want to hear any excuse!
        Look, your job perfomarnce is no
        way near good enough. It's pointless!
        I don't give a damn who your
        father is, you understand me?
        - Yeah.
        - Alright.
        Alright. Now get outta here.
        Thank you, Sir.
        Yo, Robert!
        - Yo!
        - Hey, Rocky.
        Hey, how're you doin'?
        - Hey!
        - What's up, champ'?
        You caught me off guard!
        I know I caught you off guard.
        I wanted to catch you
        before you got to busy!
        Yeah, it gets busy up there.
        - So how ya doin'?
        - Real good.
        - Yeah?
        - Yeah.
        Yo, Rock!
        Yeah, how're you doing?
        Yeah, real good.
        Hey listen, you want to go
        out and get some coffee?
        I'm kinda behind...maybe later?
        Yeah...that'd be great!
        You know, you ought to come
        by to the restaurant tonight,
        I can have something
        made special for you.
        Tonight I can't...I've got plans.
        Few other guys, stick
        together, you know...
        Did I say something wrong?
        What...what do you mean?
        Well...
        I don't know exactly what I mean,
        but I just think like when I come
        here you don't feel so comfortable,
        and I certainly don't want to do that.
        You throw a big shadow.
        A big shadow?
        You're not getting anything
        done down here, Robert.
        You're not gonna
        introduce me, then I will.
        - Hi, I am William Tomisson.
        - How ya doin'?
        Your son has the
        misfortune of working for me!
        It's a good job.
        You know, I gotta tell ya,
        I told Robert about twenty
        times that I wanted to meet you!
        But I guess you're pretty busy!
        - Which is a bad thing, isn't it?
        - Well, I get a little tired...
        Hey look, grab a shot, will you, please?
        I may not get this chance again,
        us old war horses gotta
        stick together, don't we?
        - The old horses, yeah.
        - I tell you!
        It's not your left.
        This makes very popular with people.
        - One, two, three.
        - Finally, we get to meet!
        Oh look, I kind of get going, it
        was nice to meet you face to face.
        - How ya doin'?
        - Alright, you take care of yourself.
        Robert, I'll see ya later.
        I've got to get going.
        I'll change my plans for tonight.
        Oh, that'd be great.
        - I'm looking forward to!
        - Okay.
        - How ya doin'?
        - Okay.
        - Okay!
        - Alright.
        And do not let those
        numbers drive you crazy.
        Too late!
        Use an eraser, and
        get rid of all of them!

        - Hey guys.
        - Hey Rock'!
        - Hey, how you doin'?

        You guys take care, OK?
        You got it.
        Tell you what, I'll try
        a few of these later on.
        This good for making.
        How much?
        Yo, Paul, what's the cost?
        $58.40, Sir.
        Alright, take out of that. I trust you.
        Yeah.
        - Here you go, Rock'.
        - You're generous.
        No problem!
        Hi, you guys!
        How are you doing, Isabel?
        Okay, except for the freebee
        reading the Bible over there.
        Nah, he's ok.
